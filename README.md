# Event Manager â€“ Blazor Project

**1. EventCard Component:**
- Copilot generated the initial Razor component with fields for event name, description, and date.
- Suggested two-way data binding using `@bind` and `EventCallback`.

**2. Routing:**
- Copilot recommended navigation links and the `Router` setup in `App.razor`.

**3. Performance Optimization:**
- Added scoped `AppState` service for centralized state management.
- Input validation reduces unnecessary re-renders.

**4. Advanced Features:**
- Generated a registration form with validation attributes (`[Required]`, `[EmailAddress]`).
- Managed user session data through `AppState`.
- Created Attendance Tracker page to list all registered users.

**5. Documentation:**
- This README summarizes Copilot's role in each development step.
